**EcoSnap – Gamified Garbage Reporting & Cleanup Tracker**

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement Addressed

**"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"**

**EcoSnap** addresses this by empowering communities to **report, prioritize, and track waste cleanup** through a **social, gamified approach**.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

**EcoSnap** is a **community-powered waste reporting and cleanup platform** that makes environmental action **simple, transparent, and engaging**. Drawing inspiration from **social media** and **crowdsourcing principles**, EcoSnap transforms citizens into active participants in cleaning up their surroundings.

Users can **capture and upload geotagged photos** of garbage in their area. These posts appear in a familiar **Instagram/Reddit-style feed**, encouraging community engagement. Other users **upvote** posts to prioritize garbage hotspots needing urgent attention. This **crowd-prioritized system** ensures efforts are directed where they matter most.

A **dynamic heatmap**, powered by **Google Maps API**, visualizes waste density and urgency. **Higher upvoted areas appear as warmer zones**, guiding both citizens and authorities toward pressing issues. This also serves as a **data-driven decision tool for NGOs and municipal bodies**.

A dedicated **NGO/Government Dashboard** allows organizations to **filter reports** by waste type, severity, and location. Tagged organizations can **respond directly** and **mark spots as cleaned**, updating the feed in real time—boosting transparency and morale.

EcoSnap motivates users through **points, badges, and leaderboards** for reporting and cleanup participation. **Before-and-after comparisons** visually celebrate community success and progress.

In future iterations, EcoSnap aims to integrate **AI-powered waste classification** using **Gemini API** or **Google Vision**, and collaborate with **eco-conscious businesses** and NGOs to incentivize participation via **rewards and recognition**.
