## *Project Title*

*EcoSnap ‚Äì Gamified Garbage Reporting & Cleanup Tracker*

---

## *Problem Statement Addressed*

"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"

EcoSnap addresses this challenge by empowering communities to *report, prioritize, and track waste cleanup* through a social, gamified approach.

---

## *Project Overview*

*EcoSnap* is a *community-powered waste reporting and cleanup platform* designed to make environmental action *simple, transparent, and engaging. Inspired by the best of **social media* and *crowdsourcing principles*, EcoSnap transforms everyday citizens into active participants in cleaning their neighborhoods.

The process is simple: users *capture and upload geotagged photos* of garbage in their surroundings. Posts appear in a familiar *Instagram/Reddit-style feed, making the experience intuitive and encouraging engagement. The community **upvotes* these posts to prioritize which garbage hotspots require urgent attention. This *democratic, crowd-prioritized system* ensures that cleanup efforts focus on the most impactful locations first.

A *dynamic heatmap view* powered by *Google Maps API* visualizes waste density and severity, helping communities and organizations spot problem areas at a glance. Posts with higher upvotes are displayed with *warmer, more intense colors, highlighting urgent hotspots. This not only guides citizen action but also serves as a **data-driven tool for NGOs and municipal authorities*.

For organizations, the dedicated *NGO/Government Dashboard* offers advanced tools to *filter reports by waste type, severity, and location. It highlights posts where their accounts are tagged, allowing them to **respond directly to community concerns. Authorities can also **mark locations as cleaned*, which updates the public feed, boosting community morale and transparency.

Users earn *points, badges, and leaderboard rankings* for reporting waste, participating in cleanups, and submitting proof of cleaned sites. *Before-and-after comparisons* showcase positive impact, turning the app from a complaint platform into a *celebration of environmental wins*.

In the long term, EcoSnap aims to integrate *AI-powered waste classification* using Gemini API or Google Vision, automatically tagging waste type and severity. Partnerships with *eco-friendly businesses and environmental NGOs* will further incentivize participation through rewards, discounts, and community recognition.
